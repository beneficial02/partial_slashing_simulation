# Partial Slashing Simulation
## Description

Implemented with [Agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) methodology.

You can set up the environment by `pip install mesa matplotlib jupyter`.

Developed with Python 3.

## Key Takeaways from Simulation Result

* Deposits are distributed more evenly(more decentralized) when we have a service that let us know which pool has the lowest risk from the aspect of decentralization.
* Partial slashing might not enough to induce decentralization. (see [this](https://ethresear.ch/t/partial-slashing-might-not-enough/2017) for the details)
